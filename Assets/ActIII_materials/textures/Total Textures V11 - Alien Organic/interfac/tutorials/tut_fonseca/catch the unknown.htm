  to all 3D total members and fans !</font></b></font></p>
<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Once 
again i'm here to make a short tutorial about the new outstandiang 3D total CD 
n&ordm;11 Texture - Alien Organic.This new CD is full of textures about aliens 
organic,they are amazing, great combinations of skins and surfaces, a unique collection 
that give us the chance to create great enviroments and strange characters, organic 
forms, and everything that you</font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"> 
could possible imagine. My intend was create some organic form based on a kind 
of mix between an alien and an octopus. When i start the modelling part, i had 
the form in my mind, but </font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">it 
was more difficult that i espect, because there's no references, i had to create 
some unusual, very organic and in a sort of way a creature from another world.</font>

  Scene - Modelling</font></b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">I 
  decide to use ZBrush2, this powerful software are the perfect tool to give a 
  great organic look to my model. I start with Z-spheres, this one of the great 
  tools from zbrush, easy </font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">and 
  intuitive, after that with an adaptative skin tool, give some subdivision to 
  achieve a good resolutions to my mesh, very important to the next step: sculpting 
  the model, here </font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">the 
  3 steps of the creations method of my alien organic model.</font> </p>
<p><img src="zbrush_method.jpg" width="759" height="425"> </p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#FFFFFF" size="2">I 
  had in my mind this scenario, some unknown creature was capture and unidentified, 
  possible danger. The next challenge was insert the model in an enviroment, but 
  the main purpose was to give a great look to the model, so the texture was a 
  very important part. I dicide to compose a scene where the creature is hanging 
  by strong cables and a kind of machine with claws. The cables were made with 
  a several cones and path deform. The machine with claws are poly modelling and 
  the hair part made with scatter method. Here a wire of the final scene.</font></p>

  Scene - Texturing</font></b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Well, 
  and here came the challeging part, the cd have a great variety of skins, and 
  i dicide to make a simple mix between two texture with a dirt mask. Making some 
  test with other texture these two were the best for my alien skin, i just add 
  some fallof shaders just to turn the texture more organic looking. Because of 
  the complex of the model i had to uwnrap them to fix the tile. I try to make 
  the skin a lit bit viscous by adding reflection.</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
  cables had some dirt and reflection the same material of the machine with claws, 
  the fence is a texture with a alpha opacity and a plate a metal mix material.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">I 
  made also some skin test for my alien organic model, the variety of textures 
  are great, and we can achieve some good looking skin textures, with plenty combinations, 
  it's very intresting this kind of exercise, because the results are quite surprising, 
  and a few adjustments or just changing a mask map can make the difference.</font></p>

  Scene - Lights</font></b></font></p>
<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">The 
scene was rendering with Vray, i use a single but powerful burn yellow light to 
give a dramatic look to the scene. Here the light study that i made after the 
texturization step.</font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">After 
the rendering i made some post production in photoshop, some levels and contrast 
adjustments, sharp and other final touches.</font>
