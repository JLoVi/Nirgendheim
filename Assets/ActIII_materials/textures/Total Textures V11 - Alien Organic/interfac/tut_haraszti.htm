      <p align="center"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Just 
        a short rundown on how the image was brought together. The entire scene 
        was created in 3dsmax5.1, rendered with VRay and finally the picture was 
        touched up in Photoshop.</font></p>
      <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><a href="tutorials/haraszti00lrg.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="tutorials/haraszti00.jpg" width="700" height="560" border="0"></a></font></p>

      <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Here 
        is wireframe to see entire scene in models</font></p>
      <p align="center"><img src="tutorials/haraszti01.jpg" width="700" height="497"></p>
      <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
        tree in the back with leaves were done in Onyx TreePro. The grass (or 
        whatever) was done with Advanced Nature Painter by Herman Saksono, which 
        is a script for max. You can download it from <a href="http://www.scriptspot.com">www.scriptspot.com</a> 
        and just look in the Modeling section on the left. The dead tree on the 
        right, the snake, pitcther plant and frogger are polygon models and I've 
        tried to keep them simple for a relatively low polygon count in the scene</font></p>
      <p align="center"><img src="tutorials/haraszti02.jpg" width="700" height="497"></p>
      <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This 
        entire description is really for beginners to help them discover how many 
        great things 3dsmax can do *without* purchasing expensive plugins. If 
        you visit Script Spot (link above) you will find megatons of tools, rendering 
        solutions and just about everything you need.</font></p>
      <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Now, 
        let's see how the grass was created, I get quite a few questions about 
        vegetation.</font></p>
      <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">1/ 
        Download and install Advanced Nature Painter (in the downloaded package 
        you will find the instructions about how to install the script - easy! 
        It also has two tutrial files as well to guide you)</font></p>
      <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">2/ 
        First (in the top viewport), let's create a &quot;walkway&quot;, or something 
        like that. Select the Shape/line tool, set it to Smoth/Smoth and draw 
        a shape that resembles a walkway </font></p>
      <p align="center"><img src="tutorials/haraszti03.jpg" width="542" height="383"></p>
      <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When 
        it's done, right right-click on it and click on Convert to and pick Convert 
        to Editable Poly. This is what you should see</font></p>
      <p align="center"><img src="tutorials/haraszti04.jpg" width="700" height="497"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
        </font></p>
      <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">3/ 
        I assume you've already installed Advanced Nature Painter, so please, 
        open it. I've placed it in the Tools menu, but you can access from anywhere 
        you like (3dsmax is highly customizeagle). Once the panel is open, you 
        will find out that you can adjust a lot of things. Just about anything 
        you want.Click on the three dots next to Paint to access another panel, 
        where you can adjust the grass strands parameters</font></p>
      <p align="center"><img src="tutorials/haraszti05.jpg" width="700" height="339"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
        </font></p>
      <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">4/ 
        Now click on Paint and start moving the cursor around</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">. 
        </font></p>
      <p align="center"><img src="tutorials/haraszti06.jpg" width="600" height="549"></p>
      <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">And 
        that's it, that's all to it. Here is a friendly warning: watch out, don't 
        over-do it, it's easy to add a few hundred thousands of polygons to the 
        scene. I do this in smaller increments and use only so much grass... as 
        much as I really need. Most of the times I group them and select &quot;Display 
        as box&quot; in the &quot;Properties&quot; section. Otherwise it can slow 
        down moving around in the viewports.</font></p>
      <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">And 
        this should wrap up the making of the grass. It's easy, it really is. 
        Once you get a little comfortable with Nature Painter, it's easy to get 
        addicted to it. And, it can do stones as well, or even more once <br>
        you've learned the controls.</font></p>
      <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">I used 
        3DTotal Organic/Alien texture maps for the scene, they worked really well. 
        BIG kudos to 3DTotal the quality of the maps and thank you guys for giving 
        me the opportunity to try them.</font></p>
