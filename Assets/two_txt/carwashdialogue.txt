NICE CARD!
THERE SHOULD BE ANOTHER DEVICE AT THIS BUILDING.
IT'S HUGE.
NOBODY DARED TO USE IT YET, BUT IT MIGHT WORK WITH YOUR CARD.
HAVING NO NARRATOR, WE ARE ONLY USING SMALL ONES SUCH AS THE ONE YOU SAW ON THE OTHER SIDE. 
WE USE THEM TO SMUGGLE WATER AND METAL.
HAVE A LOOK, YOU WILL FIND IT EASILY.
