27th of August.
You are looking at a screen
scattered, oversaturated images.
It feels like this place is going to crash into the sun. 40 degrees for two months.
Your eyes are getting tired.

New event:
Transit zones declared.
police and military forces have been brought to the site.
The reconstruction of the fence was successful again.
Your water levels are getting low. 
Try to get some water from the vending machine at the Metro station.

You are staring into the fire.
Either an artifact pointing towards the past..
Or an aftermath of an event.
The reconstruction of the fence was successful again.
New Event:
July. Around 3 pm.
The riot has started.
freedom! the fence is broken.
